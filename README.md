  -[] <Home />
  -[] <Informations />
  -[] <ItemList />
  -[] <Item />
  -[] <Marketing />
  -[] <Ingredient />
  -[] <Questions />
  -[] <DisplayProduct />
  -[] <Instagram />
  -[] <Footer />

- which functionalities

### At least two pages (homepage and shop page (includes shopping cart))

Let user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar (React Router)

### On the shopping cart route

A user should see a sticky bar which displays the number of items currently in the cart.
Should alse have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay.

### Build individual card items for each products.

- display an input field on it, which let a user manually type in how many items they want to buy.
- also add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tunning.
- display a title for each product as weel as an "Add to Cart" button

### Cart itself

- Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
